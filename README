Aorta is a utility for creating high quality DDS textures.

Aorta is licensed under the GNU Public License. See the file COPYING for
details.

To create DXTC compressed textures, you must have an S3TC patent license
or live in a country where the S3TC patent does not apply. If so, you
can get the Squish library from http://www.sjbrown.co.uk/?code=squish.
If you are on a Mac, get the framework, and copy squish.framework to
/Library/Frameworks.
